## Installation
First import this file system into eclipse. 
By the way, rs2xml.jar and postgresql.jar in folder "Resources"should be added as referenced Libraries.
Then we should create a database manual in localhost.(Where I have all the code in 6360P1)
It should include any technical dependencies (language, frameworks, platform, OS,
software libraries, software versions, etc.).
language : java 
compile : JavaSE-1.8 
frameworks : Swing 
platform : Eclipse for Java;
software libraries : postgresql-42.2.2.jre7.jar
database : PostgreSql
